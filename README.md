Contact Manager Application
===========================

This simple application lets register for an account and then login to access the protected area of the 'contact list'. Once you have access to the contact list you can add new contacts, update their information, and add notes to their account. This could be useful if running a company and you need to keep track of clients, allowing access to only certain people to view, edit, and add information.
